# RNGArt-scripts
JSX files for Adobe Photoshop that place pseudorandom objects on a canvas

This is the result of curiosity, and a lack of ideas for a math project.

Each JSX file is labeled with what it renders, and how many layers it renders. 
These scripts were meant to be run on a 4000x4000 canvas, but can be edited to
your liking.

The Examples folder has a few PNG renders of the results (scaled down for size).
The RNG_Art.pdf file includes a brief presentation on this project.
